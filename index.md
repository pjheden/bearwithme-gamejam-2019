In late January 2019 we attended a 48 hour hackathon called Global Game Jam. This years theme was *What means home to you?*, and in a 3 man team we started to hack away. After a lot of coffee (and not so much sleep), we had the results; **Bear With Me**.

Bear With Me is a Toy Story inspired arcade game, where you race against the time to clean up up the room.
